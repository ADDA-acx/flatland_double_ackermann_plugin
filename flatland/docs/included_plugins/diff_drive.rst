Diff Drive
==========
This plugin provides common features for a differential drive robots. All
velocities and odometries are w.r.t. the robot origin

* Subscribes to a topic publishing `geometry_msgs/Twist <http://docs.ros.org/api/geometry_msgs/html/msg/Twist.html>`_
  messages, and move the robot at the desired forward and rotation velocities

* Publishes to two topics with `nav_msgs/Odometry <http://docs.ros.org/api/nav_msgs/html/msg/Odometry.html>`_
  messages, one for robot odometry which has noise, the other the ground truth
  odometry
