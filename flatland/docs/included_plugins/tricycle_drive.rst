Tricycle Drive
==============

This plugin provides features for a specific implementation of tricycle robots.

* Subscribes to a topic publishing `geometry_msgs/Twist <http://docs.ros.org/api/geometry_msgs/html/msg/Twist.html>`_
  messages. Note the yaw rate is the angle of the front wheel instead of actual
  yaw rate.

* Publishes to two topics of `nav_msgs/Odometry <http://docs.ros.org/api/nav_msgs/html/msg/Odometry.html>`_
  messages, one for robot odometry which has noise, the other the ground truth
  odometry

The plugins makes several assumptions about the robot drive train, and uses
these assumptions to extract required geometry parameters such as wheel base
and axle track from the robot.

* Twist yaw rate is the angle of the front wheel
* Twist x velocity is the velocity at the front wheel
* The origin of the body is at the front wheel
* The model has front wheel with a revolute joint to the body, the anchor point
  on the wheel is at the origin, the anchor point on the body is at the origin
* The model has a rear left wheel with a weld joint to the body, the anchor
  point on the wheel is at the origin
* The model has rear right wheel with a weld joint to the body, the anchor point
  on the wheel is at the origin
* The perpendicular line from front wheel to rear axle (line segment from the
  rear left wheel to the rear right wheel) bisects the rear axle
* The x velocity and angle given are physically feasible, no additional checks
  are applied, and the tricycle model is used directly
* Kinematic limits can be specified for the steering angle, steering angular
  velocity, and steering angular acceleration, to model the tricycle model's
  front wheel steering response to commanded steering angle changes.
  This does not fully account for lag in the steering response, but provides a
  slightly more realistic acceleration- and velocity-bounded steering response.
  A future update will introduce the steering lag model to the tricycle plugin.

The plugin also sets the angle of the front wheel for visualization purposes, it
has no effect on the actual motion of the robot.
